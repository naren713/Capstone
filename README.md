## Sharing Benifits

- People want to buy products with maximun discount available. But most of the ecommerce sites and retailers offer maximum discount and provide cashbacks for some threshold bill value.

- People are not able to take advantage of the offers/discounts as they do not wish to spend the minimum threshold bill value.

- Some people buy unnecessary products just to meet the bill threshold value to avail the offer. They later realize that they did not need so may products.

- This APP solves that problem as users who sign in to this app can create a POST to share the offers and threshold bill value.

- This will also benefit the seller as he will have more people buy more of his products.

- For example, Brand Factory does anounce every festive season that shop for Rs 6000 and pay just Rs 3000.

- Here a user can Post for a companion for this offer in my APP and both can make use of this offer.

- This app also showcases the latest Offers going on currently and a user can directly create a Post from the Offer.
